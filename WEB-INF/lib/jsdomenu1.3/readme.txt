Description

jsDOMenu is a cross-browser navigation menu that is based on DOM. The menu 
will pop up when you left/right click in certain regions in your web page. 
You can also configure it to be absolutely positioned, fixed positioned 
(does not move with the page during scrolling) or statically positioned. It 
supports unlimited submenus, and submenu will adjust its position 
appropriately if the cursor is too near the edge. jsDOMenu is 100% HTML/XHTML 
valid, and is fully customizable through CSS. Horizontal menu bars are 
possible by installing jsDOMenuBar. Every menu item can have an icon shown 
before the display text. Tested and works in many browsers such as Mozilla, 
Mozilla Firefox/Firebird, Netscape, Opera, Safari, Camino and Microsoft 
Internet Explorer.
