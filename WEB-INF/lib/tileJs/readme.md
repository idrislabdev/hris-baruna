# tileJs

A Simple javascript replication of the subtle tilting effect when you click a tile in windows 8. Tilejs uses css3 transforms, so it is only supported by modern browsers.

## Usage

```html
<!-- Include the "metro-tile" class in your element -->
<div class="metro-tile"> This is my div, styled however I like </div>

<!-- Include the tileJs script -->
<script src="js/tileJs.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- Thats all! -->
```

## Browsers
* tileJS should work in all browsers that support css3 transforms (firefox 10+, chrome 12+, ie 10+, Safari 4+), to check your browser support, check caniuse: [here](http://caniuse.com/transforms3d "Can I use 3d transforms")
